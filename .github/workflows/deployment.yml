    #     # if a file is deleted in git it will remain around still. That's bad. Fix at some point. Not sure 
    #     # if you can just run a github actions git pull, or if I should just run a more complete delete.
    #     # Recursively delete everything except venv and folder itself, for now (rsync better probs, but meh).
    #     # TODO: this deletes the DBs each time, remove them from git, probably, and add init steps to setup steps.
